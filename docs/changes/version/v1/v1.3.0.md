	- `BaseSimpleMap` → renamed to `BaseListMap`
	- `SimpleMap` → renamed to `ListMap`
	- `SimpleDictionary` → renamed to `ListDictionary`
	- Anything `SimpleMap` related has been renamed appropriately to match `ListMap`
	- `SimpleMap` → `PairType` : `KeyType` is now const
- `MX::destruct` → returns `ref<T>` (to destructed memory)
- Changed how `tryGet()` is implemented on `JSON::JSONView`
	- Now extension is via creating a specialization of `JSON::Impl::Accessor<T>`
