## Blend Texture

Renderable object now can take an additional texture. For ease of explaining:

- **Source**: Vertex color, multiplied with the main object texture (if it exists).
- **Destination**: Blend texture.

The *destination*'s alpha gets ignored, and the *source*'s is used instead.

### Parameters

|Name|Description|Note|
|:-:|:-|:-|
|**Image**|Image associated with the texture.||
|**Strength**|Blend effect strength - i.e. how much the *source* will be blended with the *destination*.|On a per-color-channel basis.|
|**Equation**|Equation to use. For more details, refer to its associated `enum`.||
