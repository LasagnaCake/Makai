Some changes, fixes & additions may have been missed.

# Fixes

## Other fixes

- `List` → Fixed incorrect behaviour on `erase(IndexType const index)`.
- `Data` : \[`encode`, `decode`\] → Fixed incorrect behaviour.
- `Uniform` → Added `const`ness to C-style `setUniform`.

# Additions

## Skeletal animation

- `Armature` namespace for skeletal animation.
	- `Skeleton<MB>`: Represents a skeletal armature, with a max number of bones `MB`.
- `Vertebrate<MB>`: Represents an object containing a `Skeleton` of max bones `MB` named `armature`.
- `Vertex` → Added more components for skeletal animation.
	- Bone index of `-1` indicates to skip current influence.
	- Bone index of `-2` indicates end of bone influences.
	- Bone index greater than `MAX_BONES` (in this case, `64`) indicates to not apply influences.
- `Renderable` → Now inherits `Vertebrate<64>`, for skeletal animation support.
- Blender module → Now supports exporting armature.

## Other Additions

- `Transform3D` → `invert()` and `inverted()`.
- Makefile → Added way to compile only a submodule/file.

# Non-breaking changes

# Breaking changes

## Other breaking changes

- `Vertex` → Added more components (for skeletal animation purposes), so size has changed.
- Changed makefile structure drastically.
