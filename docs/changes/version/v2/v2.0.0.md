# Fixes

## Incorrect behaviour on archive subsystem

A LOT of things were broken. Now it's (maybe) working correctly.

## Other fixes

- Documentation typos
- Incorrect/missing behaviour in `TypeInfo`

# Additions

## Other Additions

- `Tree` namespace: For tree data structures.
	- `Tree::AVL`: Adelson-Velsky and Landis tree.
- `Ranges` namespace: For operations on ranges of values.
- `StateMachine<TState>`: State machine with path priority.
- `TreeMap`: Tree-based associative container.
- `HashMap`: Associative container with hashed keys.
- `ABoss` → `getCurrentAct()`.
- For music: `crossFadeInto()`.
- `FontData` → emphasis font.
- Added `UTF8Label`: Text label for UTF-8 text.
	- Along with `UTF8TextData`: Ditto old `TextData`, but for UTF-8 text.

# Non-breaking changes

## Other non-breaking changes

- Changed how `APeriodic` handles callbacks

# Breaking changes

## Text display refactor

- `FontData` → Font images are now stored in `FontData::Faces` structure.
- Changes relating to `Label`:
	- Now inherits `Base::ALablel`
	- Renamed to `CharLabel`
- Changes relating to `TextData`:
	- Renamed to `CharTextData`
	- Now an analog for `CharLabel<String>::ContentType` (AKA `Base::TextData<String>`)
- `Label` is now a template for auto-deducing label type based on string type
	- Use `String` for `CharLabel`
	- Use `UTF8String` for `UTF8Label`

## Complete `Audio` subsystem refactor

- Now uses `miniaudio` as a backend, instead of `SDL_Mixer`

## Complete `NotificationServer` subsystem refactor

- `NotificationServer` → `ANotifiable`
	- Now objects must inherit from it to receive notifications

## For game extensions: All text display is now done via `UTF8Label`

## Other breaking changes

- Changed how `RenderServer` handles callbacks
	- It is now via an interface `RenderServer::IEntity`
- Changed `arcgen` keyfile output
- `list.hpp` → moved to inside `lists/`
- `map.hpp` → moved to inside `map/`
	- `BaseSimpleMap` → renamed to `BaseListMap`
	- `SimpleMap` → renamed to `ListMap`
	- `SimpleDictionary` → renamed to `ListDictionary`
	- Anything `SimpleMap` related has been renamed appropriately to match `ListMap`
	- `SimpleMap` → `PairType` : `KeyType` is now const
- `MX::destruct` → returns `ref<T>` (to destructed memory)
- Changed how `tryGet()` is implemented on `JSON::JSONView`
	- Now extension is via creating a specialization of `JSON::Impl::Accessor<T>`
