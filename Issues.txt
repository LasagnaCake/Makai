> ctl/ctlex/container/vector.hpp throws error when compiling on GCC 14 and above
	> error: accessing 'Vector*::<unnamed union>::<anonymous>' member instead of initialized 'Vector*::<unnamed union>::data' member in constant expression
		> The code should compile in -std=gnu++20 (since the standard allows different union member access), but isn't for some reason
		> Since it compiles on version 13, it's stuck on it for now

	> [PAGE DELETED]
	> As someone on StackOverflow pointed out, it most likely is heap corruption. Hooray.
